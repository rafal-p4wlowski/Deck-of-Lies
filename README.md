## Project Description

Deck of Lies is an interactive card game that combines elements of bluffing and Russian roulette, primarily designed for live play with friends. This game is inspired by the mechanics of popular bluffing games, being an unofficial interpretation of concepts that combine tactical card play with an element of randomness.

## Game Rules

### Game Objective

Players try to convince others that their declarations about the cards they hold are true â€“ even if they're bluffing. The goal is to eliminate opponents through Russian Roulette or be declared a winner by the other players. The last remaining active player who hasn't won becomes the loser.

### Game Mechanics

1. Physical cards are in the players' hands. The app is only a digital assistant for gameplay.
2. On their turn, a player plays cards that should match the current table card (Q, K, or A).
3. The next player can either believe and add their cards or challenge the truthfulness of the previous player by saying "Liar!".
4. If a player's declaration turns out to be true â€“ the challenger must pull the trigger of the revolver.
5. If bluffing is discovered â€“ the player who lied must pull the trigger.
6. After each shot, a new table card is drawn.
7. Players can use the "Declare Winner" [W] button to select an active player and declare them a winner.
8. The game ends when only one active (alive and not declared a winner) player remains. This last player loses the game. The game also ends if all remaining players are declared winners.
